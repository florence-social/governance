## Where does this CoC apply and who does this CoC apply to?

This code of conducts applies to all official public discussion forums related to this project, including but not limited to public chat, forums, and comments on code.

This code applies to any member of the community participating in discussions, contributing to the project, or otherwise discussing the project publicly.

It also would apply in the future main Florence instance. Members of the instance must agree to the CoC.


## When Something Happens

If you see behavior that is not aligned with this Code of Conduct, here’s how you can handle it.

Consider the situation and if it might be useful to screenshot messages in case the messages in question are deleted.

The person may not be completely aware of the Code of Conduct or specific items within it. You can start by letting them know that their actions weren’t appropriate and point them to specific parts of the Code of Conduct. One suggestion is to send a private message first, because this can avoid potentially embarrassing someone.

Politely and patiently let the person know that their behavior isn’t in line with the Code of Conduct. Share the code of conduct with them and refer to specific parts which you think their behavior is not in line with. You may ask them to adjust their behavior or possibly edit or delete a message.

If they refuse to change their behavior or delete text which is not in line with the CoC, it may be time to report the incident. See how to report an incident in the following section. You may also directly contact admins or moderators, especially if the behavior requires immediate attention

Example: Mary calls John an ableist slur in a dicussion chat because he made a mistake. Ana tells Mary via DM that he shouldn't do that because it reinforces the opression of disabled or neurodivergent people, but Mary calls Ana the same slur, and that she shouldn't take this so seriously. Then, Ana proceeds to report Mary to a moderator.


## How to make a Code Of Conduct Report

"If you would like to report a Code of Conduct violation contact $X via $Y. Regardless of outcome, $X (or committee) will respond in private to you as the reporter with an explanation of the actions taken within a time frame $Z days."

Please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

Example: Ana reports Mary. She explains the situation and gives the links and screenshots as proof to the moderator. The moderator examines the case and decides to give Mary a warning. Mary is told this and she will be not longer able to participate if she does that again.
How CoC Reports are handled by moderators

When a Code of Conduct report is made, moderators should take the issue seriously. If it’s not possible to deal with the report immediately, moderators should send a response saying that the report was received and is being looked into.

Moderators will take all reports seriously and prioritize the well-being and comfort of the person making the report recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.

As soon as available, a moderator will join, identify themselves, and take further action, starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.

Offer people the kind of support they ask for. If you aren't sure what you're offering will be helpful, ask if that type of thing would be useful.


## Accountability for board members and moderators

Board members, moderators, and other community members who contributed to running this project will be held to the same code of conduct. Reports against those in positions of power will be taken seriously and handled with respect, prioritizing the safety and well-being of anyone who makes such a report.
